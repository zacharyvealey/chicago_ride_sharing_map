# chicago_ride_sharing_map
A map showing the time-colored frequency of ride-hailing pickups for the Chicago area on 12/15/2018 using the data 
set made available at <https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p>.

The map shows circles with radii dictated by the number of ride-sharing pickups to occur at a specific GPS location. The circles include the location as well as the most frequent hour that pickups occurred at that location (where warm colors constitute a gradient for day pickups and cool colors a likewise gradient for night pickups).
